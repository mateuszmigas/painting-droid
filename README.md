Painting Droid is an AI-powered cross-platform painting app inspired by the legendary MS Paint, but expandable with plugins and open. It utilizes various AI models, from paid providers to self-hosted open-source models, as well as some lightweight ones built into the app. It works in the browser and as a desktop app on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Features

- Your regular painting app features (e.g., brush, annotate, fill, etc.).
- Fill selected areas with AI-generated content.
- Augment selected areas with AI-generated content (e.g., add a tree to a landscape or remove the background).
- Apply filters and effects to the entire image or a selected area.
- Resize, crop, rotate, and flip the image.
- Plugin support.
- Cross-platform compatibility.
