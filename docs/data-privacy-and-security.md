# Data Privacy and Security

The application does not collect any user data. Your current state, including workspaces and settings, is saved locally on your device, ensuring you can resume work seamlessly. API Keys are securely stored using your operating systemâ€™s key manager (Keychain for macOS, Credential Manager for Windows). The application operates offline except when connecting to external AI model providers like OpenAI or StabilityAI for specific features. During these interactions, only necessary data (e.g., prompts and selected layer pixels) are transmitted over a secure connection.
